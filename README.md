## Sparkmeters

_Inline graphics that indicate relative value_

Sparkmeters are lightweight, inline graphics that give the relative value of an item. They are inspired by Edward Tufte's [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline). They are designed to be unobtrusive and low information. Unlike sparklines, sparkmeters can't usually stand on their own, but are best used to give the relative value of a group of items (e.g. a list of skills on a resume).

A demo can currently be seen [here](http://cs.unm.edu/~rkeyes/sparkmeters/).

This version of sparkmeters is implemented with the D3.js library. The source code is licensed under a BSD-style open source license (see License.txt).
